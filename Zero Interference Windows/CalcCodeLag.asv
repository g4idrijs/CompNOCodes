% Given two focal regions deltaF apart at depth L
% and codes of length N, sampling frequency fs, and speed of sound c
% calculates:
% time lag between return of two codes to a single transducer
% divided by the time it takes for a whole code to return
% (what fraction of a code length are the codes offset in time)

sqrt(L^2 + deltaF^2
