As we bring a second point close to our focus point of interest:
-The reflection from the other point arrives closer in time
(top is sooner - smaller time values)
-It arrives sooner at a lot of transducers (on the other side)
-It arrives later on the same side

Restrict receive aperture to same side for the moment
Try and get good image using just one aperture for just
one point phantom.

Want to try and have two point scatterers, and eliminate effect
of second one when focusing on only one
(delete data that arrives later)
